### 👥 Collaboration Rules
- Never push directly to `main` branch.
- Create a new branch for every feature or bugfix:
  `feature/<your-name>-<task>`
- Commit small, meaningful changes.
- Always open a Pull Request (PR) to merge into `dev` or `main`.
- Request at least 1 reviewer before merging.
- Make sure CI checks pass before merge.
